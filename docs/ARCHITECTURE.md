# Atlas Architecture

## R2 Buckets

Three Cloudflare R2 buckets. Public access means the browser fetches directly; private means only Vercel API functions or the pipeline can read it.

### atlas (public)

Current static GTFS data served to the frontend.

- `atlas/{slug}.json` — route GeoJSON for each agency
- `atlas/{slug}-stops.json` — stops index
- `atlas/{slug}-corridors.json` — corridor overlap data
- `atlas/go-stops.json` — GO rail stops (separate extract)

Written by: `pipeline/refresh.ts`, `pipeline/process-gtfs.ts`
Read by: browser directly via `R2_PUBLIC_URL`

### atlas-archive (private)

Historical and reference data not needed at runtime.

- `gtfs/archive/{slug}/{feed-end-date}.zip` — raw GTFS zip snapshots, one per feed version
- `history/{slug}/latest.json` — most recent headway snapshot for diff detection
- `history/{slug}/{feed-end-date}.json` — versioned headway snapshots (pipeline diff-detection; not read by frontend)

Written by: `pipeline/refresh.ts` (both gtfs zips and history snapshots)
Read by: `pipeline/refresh.ts` only (reads `history/{slug}/latest.json` to detect week-to-week changes)

### atlas-live (private)

Real-time GTFS-RT snapshots from the Cloudflare Worker archiver. Canary cohort is
**smaller** than the browser Live Vehicles set — see `docs/LIVE_POLLING.md` § History Archiving.

- `positions/{slug}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{unix-seconds}.json` — vehicle-position samples (currently TTC streetcars, every minute)
- `{slug}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{unix-seconds}.json` — trip-update delay summaries (ttc, burlington, hamilton, stm; self-gated every 5th minute)
- Both formats use the `atlas.live.v1` normalized envelope; legacy fields remain during migration.

Written by: Cloudflare Worker (`workers/gtfs-rt-archiver/`) — cron every minute + daily 04:00 UTC cleanup
Read by: `/api/live-snapshot`, `/api/live-replay`, `/api/history-adherence` (not direct browser R2)

30-day retention enforced by the Worker's daily cleanup cron.


## Live Polling: three surfaces (often conflated)

### 1. Browser on-demand (while Live is open)

Client polls `/api/live-vehicles` (and stop/adherence helpers). Route list and key gates:
`shared/livePollingConfig.ts` (`LIVE_POLLING_ROUTES`). Includes public feeds (e.g. burlington,
hamilton, ttc, edmonton, yrt, halifax) and key-gated ones (TransLink, STM, SF Muni `active`,
LA Metro parked).

### 2. Background Worker archiver

Hardcoded feed lists in `workers/gtfs-rt-archiver/src/index.ts` (not `LIVE_POLLING_ROUTES`):
trip-updates for **ttc, burlington, hamilton, stm**; positions for **ttc streetcars** only.
Writes private `atlas-live`. Expand only after canary health + contract checks.

### 3. Provider consumers (snapshot / replay)

`/api/live-snapshot` and `/api/live-replay` read `atlas-live` for Bridge and verification tools.
History UI also uses schedule-period headway diffs from `atlas-archive` (pipeline) — a different
meaning of “history” than RT delay archives.


## Data Flow: Weekly Refresh

```
feedUrl (agency's GTFS zip) 
  -> pipeline/refresh.ts
    -> parse GTFS
    -> write atlas/{slug}.json          (public, replaces previous)
    -> write atlas/{slug}-stops.json    (public)
    -> write atlas/{slug}-corridors.json (public)
    -> write gtfs/archive/{slug}/*.zip  (atlas-archive, append)
    -> compare vs history/{slug}/latest.json (atlas-archive)
    -> if changed: write history/{slug}/{period}.json + latest.json (atlas-archive)
```

Triggered by: GitHub Actions weekly cron (Monday), or `npm run refresh`


## Vercel API Routes

`/api/*` routes are Vercel serverless functions — they do NOT run in the Vite dev server.
Local: `npm run dev:api` (custom tsx server; not full parity with every Node-style handler).
Production-like: `vercel dev` if preferred.

- `/api/live-vehicles` — on-demand GTFS-RT vehicle positions + delays for Live UI
- `/api/live-stop` — predicted (and TTC observed) arrivals at a stop
- `/api/live-adherence` — on-demand route adherence panel
- `/api/live-snapshot` — latest versioned canary snapshot with freshness state
- `/api/live-replay` — bounded versioned snapshot replay for validation and consumers
- `/api/history-adherence` — aggregates trip-delay archives from `atlas-live` into hourly buckets
- `/api/gtfs-rt` — legacy raw proto→JSON proxy (burlington/hamilton only)
