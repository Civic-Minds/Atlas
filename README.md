# Atlas: The Unified Transit Intelligence Ecosystem

Atlas is a comprehensive platform for urban mobility, designed to provide a closed-loop feedback system for transit planning and analysis.

## 🏗️ Pipeline

The ecosystem is structured around three core phases:

1.  **Intelligence** (Cleaning & Integrity): Ensuring data represents reality.
2.  **Strategy** (Modeling & Simulation): Testing changes in a safe environment.
3.  **Discovery** (Viewing & Public Engagement): Understanding and sharing the network.

## 🛠️ Modules

-   **[Screen](src/modules/screener)**: Automated GTFS analysis and route tiering.
-   **[Verify](src/modules/verifier)**: human-in-the-loop validation interface.
-   **[Simulate](src/modules/simulator)**: Stop consolidation and performance modeling.
-   **[Optimize](src/modules/optimize)**: (In Development) Generative AI for route optimization.
-   **[Atlas](src/modules/home)**: National longitudinal database viewer and base map.

## 🗺️ Roadmap
For the full vision and upcoming features (Access, Optimize, Collaborate, Monitor), see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## 📜 Legacy
This repository evolved from the **Frequent Transit Networks** project. The original source code and documentation can be found in the [legacy/](legacy/) directory, and the original standalone repositories [Frequency](https://github.com/Civic-Minds/Frequency) and [Simulator](https://github.com/Civic-Minds/Simulator) are now archived.
